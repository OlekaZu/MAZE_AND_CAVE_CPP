# PROJECT_MAZE_AND_CAVE_CPP
The App allows render on the screen the mazes and the caves loaded from the files or generated (max size 50x50). Also it allows render the  maze solving way between two given points and automated generation using a cellular automaton.

_**This App is developed together with @iitrukha1989 and .**_

My actual work in this project consists of the following matters:
- generation of the maze according to Eller's algorithm, 
- solving the maze (wave algorithm of finding the shortes).

### How to Compile the App


### Work with Mazes
There are two tabs in the Apps - MAZE and CAVE. After the App is opened, you can see the following window:
